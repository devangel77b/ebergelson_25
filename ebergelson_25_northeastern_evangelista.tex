I am happy to recommend \firstname\ \lastname\ for the Northeastern University Pre-college Program. Eric was a student in my 9th grade physics class in 2021, my drone engineering class in the fall of 2023, and he is currently in my 11th grade biology class. Eric is also a member of the Drone Club which I advise.  

In biology, Eric has shown a continuously increasing grade each biology test he has taken.  He is interested in the material, asks questions, comes for extra help when needed, and answers well on tests. His lighthearted competition with his friend has improved both of their grades. In drone engineering, Eric worked well with a partner on the design of an underwater remotely operated vehicle based on the design of the SeaPerch ROV.  Eric led his team in developing and testing underwater thrusters using DC motors; his design was modular and able to be mounted to a variety of stock ROV frames based on PVC pipe. Eric led testing of these thrusters in both fresh and salt water, leading up to a long term stress test in which the thrusters were immersed in salt water for up to three days, showing his design would function during a standard mission. 

Eric is developing scientific and technical abilities that could add depth to your program. A summer pre-college experience would also further motivate Eric to focus on his studies, as he builds enthusiasm for college and the things he might study there. I recommend him highly for your program.

% From form to function, I enjoy watching ideas come into being. It is what inspires me to grow my toolbox of skills in science research. My interests are in the application of technologies to improve human life, especially as it relates to environmentalism. I participated in a two-week Marine Biology experience focused on the development of systems that help monitor coastal environments. I have also participated in summer studies in Industrial Design, Biomedical Engineering, and Drone Engineering, and have learned to use CAD for architectural design. Understanding how builders create structures to fit in with their surroundings interests me. As a member of the program, I look forward to joining my host community in putting these skills to use. Cultural migration of ideas is a catalyst for human advancement. While sharing my training, I will add to my toolbox, learning local customs in agriculture, and animal husbandry, and observing how community structures reflect cultural practices.
%I am especially looking forward to becoming part of both the local community and my volunteer community. I love bridging my experiences with those of others and have discovered that I learn by gaining new perspectives when I am teaching others. I enjoyed volunteering in the summers at my middle school, teaching math to 6-8-year-olds, and running sports clinics focused on teamwork. I also volunteer at my synagogue’s Youth services, running holiday fairs. I am excited to bring my love of play to my Tanzanian host community. 
%As a lover of the outdoors, I am looking forward to the excursion to Mt. Kilimanjaro and the Safari and Maasai Lands outing. It is a privilege to see the natural wonders of the world, and it is knowledge I hope to share as I continue my environmental work.
